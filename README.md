Vectorized Solutions to Machine Learning Algorithms using OCTAVE
================================================================

<b>What is it?</b>

Vectorized Solutions to exercise for Standford Machine Learning class https://class.coursera.org/ml-003/class


<b>What is here?</b>

Vectroized solutions to find the minimized fitting parameters are included in this examples


<b>Why this repo? </b>

Future reference for myself and students who are interested in machine learning.

<b>What can be learned?</b>
<ul>
<li>Linear regression - Cost function, Gradient</li>
<li>Logistic regression - Cost function , Gradient, Normal Equation</li>
